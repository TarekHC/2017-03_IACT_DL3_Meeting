# Planning call March 13

* Christoph Deil and all - Plan for face-to-face meeting next week
  * We will start Monday at 14:30, have eZuce remote connection
  * Contributions welcome!
  * Short-term goals (this week and next few weeks) - spec additions to support existing DL3 from CTA and current IACTs
  * Mid-term goals (next months) - Write a document summarising what DL3 could look like (in terms of content, but also file size) for CTA (focusing only on per-run IRFs?)
* Tarek Hassan - a proposal how to support point-like IRFs (pull request coming before the call, for now see https://github.com/open-gamma-ray-astro/gamma-astro-data-formats/issues/71)
*
