## About

This is a meeting on the data level 3 (DL3) data model and formats for imaging atmospheric Cherenkov (IACT) telescopes.

* The topic is data level 3 (DL3), i.e. the interface between pipeline and science tools. See ["Open high-level data formats and software for gamma-ray
astronomy" (2016)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016arXiv161001884D) for an introduction / overview / status / next steps on DL3.
* The main focus is on [CTA](https://www.cta-observatory.org/)! Participation by existing IACTS (e.g. H.E.S.S., MAGIC, VERITAS, FACT), or similar telescopes (e.g. HAWC, neutrinos) is encouraged, their experience especially with instrument response functions (IRFs) is an important input for the discussions.
* This is a follow-up on the workshop from last year (see [2016-04_IACT_DL3_Meeting](https://github.com/open-gamma-ray-astro/2016-04_IACT_DL3_Meeting)).
* The meeting will be announced on the [open-gamma-ray-astro](https://lists.nasa.gov/mailman/listinfo/open-gamma-ray-astro) mailing list and cta-data, and forwarding to analysis mailing lists of existing IACTs is welcome.

Goals of the meeting are:
* Make progress on the DL3 specifications at [gamma-astro-data-formats](http://gamma-astro-data-formats.readthedocs.io/).
* We have been stuck a bit since last year with major questions concerning
  the data model and formats, e.g. on how to organise the data and link the pieces. Other major points are listed in [2016arXiv161001884D](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016arXiv161001884D).
  We would like to make some real progress on those key DL3 issues, and try
  to define something that can support CTA well and can be prototyped for the coming year.

The following things are not topics at this workshop:
* CTA pipeline or science tool software development. DL3 is the interface between these softwares, and participation and feedback by people working on those codes is highly encouraged. But the focus here is on the DL3 specs, work on the codes to implement or prototype can then continue after the meeting.
* Lower-level data, e.g. air shower images.
* Higher-level data, e.g. sky images or spectra.
