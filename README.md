## About

This is a four day face-to-face meeting on open data and software in gamma-ray
astronomy. The goal is to bring the community of people developing open
high-level data formats and tools together, to exchange ideas and foster
collaboration.

Please see th ["Open high-level data formats and software for gamma-ray
astronomy" (2016)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016arXiv161001884D) paper for
an introduction to this project, join the
[open-gamma-ray-astro](https://lists.nasa.gov/mailman/listinfo/open-gamma-ray-astro)
mailing list and have a look at the
[gamma-astro-data-formats](http://gamma-astro-data-formats.readthedocs.io/)
specifications, as well as the materials from previous similar meetings:
["Python for gamma-ray astronomy" (November
2015)](http://gammapy.github.io/PyGamma15/) and [IACT DL3 data format meeting
(April 2016)](https://github.com/open-gamma-ray-astro/2016-04_IACT_DL3_Meeting).

Some preliminary information about this meeting:

* This is a workshop for experts, not a school for end users.
* Goals and formats:
  * Discuss, decide, and implement as many open data format issues as possible (see list [here](https://github.com/open-gamma-ray-astro/gamma-astro-data-formats/issues)), by working in small groups.
  * Some time will be spent on status reports (e.g. from HESS, MAGIC, CTA and maybe science tools) or to give people the room to pitch new ideas (e.g. for IRFs or HEALPIX or ... formats).
* Topics: 
  * IACT (CTA, HESS, MAGIC, FACT, ...) DL3 data formats will  be the biggest topic.
  * Extensions to other equivalent data (e.g. from slewing instrumetns like HAWC or neutrino or cosmic ray telescopes) are welcome.
  * Higher-level data formats (e.g. lightcurves, HEALPIX images) will also be a topic
  * Probably software developement will also be a topic, especially for possibilities for more collaboration and interoperability.
* Further suggestions welcome!
